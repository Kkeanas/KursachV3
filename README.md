# SPRING NOTE PROJECT
Hello, it's my updated project that i dropped on github.

It's show my skills of using Spring.

To start you need to use docker
1. By Using Gradle package project without tests
./gradlew build -x test
```
mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip
```
2. Using docker compose application
```
docker-compose up --build
```
After you can find my project on 
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Also project has swagger created by SpringDoc
[http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/)
